# Journey of developing this project

Aside from my personal website which is still in the process, this is my very first functioning project that I made when I'm re-learning my programming. This project focuses on Javascript, and some HTML and CSS.

This is where I really discovered, I really liked coding and debugging. The way how the codes interact, how functions and variable work. And the moment that my code works as I imagine it to, it has an indescribable feeling for me. Everytime that happens, my mind goes crazy and begins thinking of multiple ways this can be used in future project.

So below are some info on how I developed this project.
